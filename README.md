# MD-for-LJ-liquid-Argon

This program simulates liquid Argon using a Leonard JOnes (LJ) potential and allows to calculate the radial distribution function (RDF), the pressure and the energy.

Moreover it incorporates a refinement of the employed Boundary Conditions which allow to calculate the velocity autocorrelation function (VACF) and the mean square displancement (MSD), providing insights into the system dynamics.

## Example of the Energy conversion over the iterations

The following plot shows the convergence of the different energy contributions as a function of the simulation length, as an example of some of the results that can be obtained by performing such a MD simulation.
